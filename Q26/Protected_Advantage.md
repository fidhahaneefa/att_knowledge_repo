Loss due to indirect or consequential loss, intentional acts, dishonest acts, fraudulent acts, criminal acts, abuse, technological obsolescence or depreciation, cosmetic damage, accidental damage from handling, unauthorized repair or replacement, pollutants, failure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions, manufacturer recall, mechanical or electrical failure, malware, nuclear reaction or radiation, war, governmental action, damage to data, nonstandard external media, and nonstandard software, and failure to reasonably protect the device from any further loss are excluded.

## Protect Advantage for 4
### How it works

• One primary eligible device must be connected to a monthly AT&T post-paid wireless plan (connected device).
• The second, third, and fourth eligible devices can be connected to a monthly AT&T post-paid plan (including smartphones, and connected tablets or laptops on the same account). They may also be Wi-Fi only tablets that are not connected to a monthly rate plan.
• Your primary connected device is automatically registered at the time of enrollment but your second, third, and fourth devices can be registered later when you file a claim.
• You cannot have more than 4 eligible devices registered at any time.
• 30-day waiting period after enrollment for non-connected devices is required before coverage applies.
• Once a claim is approved your mobile number (connected device) or device (non-connected device) is registered and will remain registered as one of your four covered mobile number/devices for a period of 12 months.
• After 12 months (from the date of the approved claim), your covered mobile number (connected) or device (non-connected) registration can be changed.
• Each approved claim restarts the 12 month registration period for that mobile number/device.
• Although unlimited, each approved screen repair, battery and out-of-warranty malfunction replacement requires the repaired device to be registered (registration can be changed 12 months from the date of the approved claim).
