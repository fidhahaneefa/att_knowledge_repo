What is an Installment plan?
Instead of paying the full price upfront when you buy a new smartphone, you can choose to pay for your device on an installment plan. An installment plan takes the full price of your new device and spreads it across several months, so you'll have a predictable, low monthly payment. Plus, you won't pay any finance fees or interest. 

With well-qualified credit, you can get the latest smartphone for $0 down with eligible service. Taxes on the smartphone are due at the time of sale. Other credit-qualified customers may need to make a down payment of 15% to 80% of the sales price or a fixed amount between $200 and $1,400. We'll then divide the remaining smartphone amount into 36 low monthly installment payments. After you pay off your smartphone in full, you can upgrade (no need to turn in your old device).

What's the length of a new installment plan?
The AT&T Installment Plan with or without Next Up Anytime is 36 months.

With Next Up Anytime, for an additional $10 per month, you can turn in your device and upgrade after one installment plan payment.


What do I pay upfront when I buy a smartphone on an installment plan?
You'll pay taxes on the full device price at the point of sale. You may also have to make a down payment. The down payment amount depends on a variety of factors including your credit, how long you've been an AT&T customer, and your payment history. The down payment amount also depends on how many devices you're financing.


Do I have to sign an agreement to get an installment plan?
Yes, you'll need to sign an installment agreement. This agreement explains what you'll pay each month for your smartphone and other details. You must have eligible talk and data service for your smartphone throughout your agreement. For new customers, eligible service plans begin at $50 per month after AutoPay and paperless billing discounts (for new business customers, $50 per month after AutoPay discount). If you're an existing customer, you can add your new smartphone to an eligible existing plan, which may cost less.  

If you cancel your wireless service, the unpaid balance on the smartphone is due. Also, AT&T requires a month-to-month Consumer Service Agreement for your wireless service or a qualified business agreement. 


What happens if I cancel wireless service or fail to make a payment for a smartphone on an installment plan?
If you cancel your wireless service through AT&T, you'll owe the remaining unpaid installment balance on the smartphone.


Why does my retail installment agreement state that it has been assigned to AT&T Mobility Next Operations LLC? What does that mean?
If you purchased your device on an AT&T Installment Plan at a non-AT&T branded store (e.g., a National Retailer like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, etc.), then your agreement was sold and assigned to AT&T Mobility Next Operations LLC (NMLS#1186562). Your installment plan has been and will continue to be billed by AT&T on your wireless account.
